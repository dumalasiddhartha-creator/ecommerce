# ⚠️ Node.js Installation Required

## You need to install Node.js first!

### Quick Installation Steps:

1. **Download Node.js**
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/
   - Click the **LTS version** (recommended) - it's the green button
   - This will download the installer

2. **Install Node.js**
   - Run the downloaded installer (`.msi` file)
   - Click "Next" through all prompts
   - ✅ Make sure "Add to PATH" is checked (it should be by default)
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait for installation to complete

3. **Restart Your Terminal**
   - Close this terminal/command prompt
   - Open a NEW terminal/command prompt
   - This is important so it picks up the new PATH

4. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   You should see version numbers (like `v20.x.x` and `10.x.x`)

5. **Navigate to Project Folder**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\Palepally Snigdha\Desktop\ecommerce"
   ```

6. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will take 2-3 minutes

7. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

8. **Open Browser**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000
   - Your store will be running! 🎉
